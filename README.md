# nixos configuration

multimedia server!

todo:
- [x] download and play Dune 
- [x] comment whats what
- [ ] deploy this config to bare metal
- [ ] expose over local network
- [ ] set up local dns for nice urls (PiHole!)
- [ ] VPN entire thing (god help me)
- [ ] sort of failover 

nice to have:
- [ ] \*arr do not have declarative config(s), standing this up on bare metal will mean clicking indexers, etc again and wiring them up together
